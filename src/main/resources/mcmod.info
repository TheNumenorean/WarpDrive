Explore the space dimension: asteroids (filled with ores), asteroid fields, gas clouds, planetoids, stars, and NPC-ships.
Jump to hyperspace for long-range traveling!
Set up laser cannons on your ship to fight with other players' ships, or craft a mining laser to collect valuable resources on Earth or in space.
Cloak your ship, base or a space station from your enemies!
And lots more!",
